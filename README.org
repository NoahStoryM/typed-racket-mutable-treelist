* Typed Racket-Compatible Mutable Treelist Library
The ~unsafe-typed-racket-mutable-treelist~ package provides a typed wrapper
around the ~racket/mutable-treelist~ module in Racket. It introduces specific
types to manage both read and write operations using Racket's ~Parameter~ type
to simulate invariant types.

** Installation
You can install the package from the Racket package manager using:
#+begin_src shell
raco pkg install unsafe-typed-racket-mutable-treelist
#+end_src

** Usage
The package provides a typed API for creating and managing mutable treelists in
Typed Racket.

** Technical Details
Typed Racket currently lacks support for contravariant types in type constructors,
so ~unsafe-typed-racket-mutable-treelist~ relies on a ~Mutable-TreeListof~ struct
with ~Parameter~ types for read and write constraints.

** License
~unsafe-typed-racket-mutable-treelist~ is distributed under the MIT License.
